        <h1>Eyeblight</h1>
        <p>Eyeblight is a 2D platformer where the protagonist's eyes grant supernatural abilities that affect gameplay in eerie and thrilling ways. The game blends exploration, puzzle-solving, and light combat with a psychological horror twist.</p>
        <p>You play as a character with otherworldly eyes that reveal and interact with the world in strange ways. The environment is filled with unsettling locations like decaying forests and industrial wastelands, where you'll uncover secrets and face creepy enemies.</p>   
        <p>Movement: Standard 2D platformer controls—arrow keys/WASD for movement, space for jump.</p>
        <p>Switching Eyes: Equip and switch between eyes to solve puzzles, fight, or evade danger.</p>
        <p>Combat: Light combat, with each eye offering different strategies.</p>
        <p>Exploration & Puzzle-Solving: Eyes help reveal paths and overcome obstacles.</p>
        <p>Unlock new eyes as you progress through stages filled with challenges, enemies, and environmental hazards. Adapt and switch eyes to survive.</p>
