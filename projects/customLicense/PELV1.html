        People’s Engine License (PEL) v1.0

        Preamble
        This license is designed to keep the engine source code free, open, and modifiable by anyone — forever.
        At the same time, it respects creators’ freedom to license their own games and content however they wish.
        This fosters a healthy ecosystem where the engine remains a shared community asset, and your creations remain your own.

        1. Definitions
        • “Engine”: The software codebase covered by this license, including source code and associated files.
        • “Work” or “Game”: Any software, game, mod, or content created using the Engine.
        • “You” or “Licensee”: Anyone who uses, modifies, distributes, or creates derivative works of the Engine.
        • “Source Code”: The human-readable form of the Engine’s code.

        2. Grant of Rights
        • You may use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Engine source code.
        • Any modified or derivative version of the Engine must be distributed under this same license and remain open source.
        • You must provide full access to the Source Code of any Engine derivative you distribute.
        • You may not impose additional restrictions that would prevent others from exercising these rights on the Engine.

        3. Freedom of Works (Games and Content)
        • Works created using the Engine are not required to be open source.
        • You may license, sell, or distribute your Works under any terms, including closed source, proprietary, or DRM-protected licenses.
        • The Engine’s open source requirements do not apply to your Works.

        4. Distribution
        • You may distribute the Engine or derivative Engines in source or compiled binary form, provided that you include this license and make the source code available.
        • You may distribute Works using the Engine without providing their source code.

        5. Modding and API Access (If the engine supports it)
        • If your Work supports modding through the Engine’s APIs or scripting interfaces, you should not block or restrict access to those interfaces unless explicitly stated for security or legal reasons.
        • You are encouraged to keep modding capabilities intact to foster community creativity.
        • The engine and its derivatives must preserve modding and API access and may add to these capabilities but shall never remove or restrict modding options available in the engine.

        6. Attribution
        • You must include clear attribution to the original Engine author(s) in your distributions and derivative works, either in a README file or in the compiled ‘About’ section. You may add your own name alongside the original authors, but the original attribution must be clearly visible and not obscured or hidden.
        • Providing a link to the original Engine in the README file is encouraged but not required.

        7. Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability
        • The Engine is provided “as-is,” without warranty of any kind, express or implied.
        • In no event shall the authors be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability arising from the use of the Engine.

        8. License Versioning
        • This license is version 1.0. Future versions may be released to address community needs or improvements.
