        <p>12/04/2025 – Day of the Incident, 3:50 PM</p>
        <p>Alarms are blaring, hearts are pounding, nobody even knows what could of went wrong, that monster its ripping through everything and everyone just to get to its target, how do we know this? Simple we tested the monster, and it targets the first one it sees who it saw first, well my boss was walking past its door this morning, I knew we never should of gave that door a window, he didn’t listen and now he’s running like a fool, a fool that should have listened. Me? I’m hiding stay out of its way is the only way to live at least that’s what we learned from the testing, don’t look at it and don’t even breathe near it, if it knows your alive you will become a target of the monster, the ruin it causes the death I’ve seen and yet that all is normal, this job is a high fatality rate, the screams, the blood, the sorrow well you learn that’s a quick way to become the next one in line, all we need to do is capture it, shove it in a box where no one can see that god awful monster again, and hope it doesn’t see you next. If we live to see that day at least, with it ripping through the halls like this, well it’s not the only monster we keep captive, at least they were captive, I don’t think they are anymore and it’s not the worst thing we have brought in, all I can be sure of is I hope to god I’m not next in line for his job.</p>

        <p>13/04/2025 – Day 2, 3:00 AM</p>
        <p>Those monsters, they are everywhere now, I wish we knew what we were doing and how we could stop it, all it took was just under 12 hours, they rip and tear through everything demons the lot of them, I’ve been running from facility to facility, not much remains of the known world, I just hope the unknown world is ready cause if they aren’t well they will end up with the same fate as all of us. After all, if they can destroy the known world in under 12 hours, what’s different about the unknown world, how safe can you truly be? Running, bleeding, eating, drinking, all delays a universal constant, death. apart of this makes me wonder, was this fate could we have changed something to escape it? Of cause the answer would always have been no, I have no idea if me surviving is a blessing or a curse and right now I don’t think it matters, all that’s between me and them is a single hard wood door, bullets don’t work after all,</p>
        <br>
        <p>14/04/2025 – Day 3, 3:30 AM</p>
        <p>Somehow the power is still on, do these monsters not rip through power cables? They shouldn’t need it to survive right? Whatever it is I’m glad, it keeps me able to type this journal which is the only think keeping me sane, however food and water well that’s a whole other issue, leaving this room today would end in death for sure, as whatever these things are, they don’t like the human flesh, I would hope for peace of a quick death, but I still hear the screams from the humans, I doubt it will be quick they seem to enjoy the sound of pain from us, it sickens me to the core, hearing screams all around me, what stops them from finding me, what makes them ignore this room, ignore this building? Is it some cruel twist of fate, someone twisting the knife while I’m already desperate, or maybe it’s what we deserve after what we put those monsters through, it’s a funny thing, it sounds like I want to live through this painful existence.</p>
        <br>
        <p>15/04/2025 – Day 4, 5:51 PM</p>
        <p>I’m not sure if I could survive much longer, low food, low water the only thing I can count on is the constant 20 hertz hum of the lights above, If I leave I’m doomed for sure however if I stay, I’m dead I only have enough food and water left for today, the protocol stated that everyone carry 4 days’ worth of food at all times in case of this situation, but I’m guessing it was never guessed that it would be the end of the world. I bet my bosses escaped when they could, after all they always must live at the cost of us, stupid government never thought about giving us more funding, that could have stopped all this, I mean stronger walls better security, more staff, our own armory and strike forces, that could be prepared for situations like this. That would have solved everything, we did what we could, but you cannot expect a homeless person to solve world hunger. So why did they expect us to solve it with limited funding.</p>
        <br>
        <p>16/04/2025 – Day 5, 12:00 AM</p>
        <p>The running the screaming, that’s all I could hear as I made a break for the cafeteria, I made it there, almost dead, starving and dehydrated, got to the tap took in a lot of water and ate all I could find, after all, one got my leg, I didn’t see it which is lucky, as if you don’t look at them, they think you’re a dead corpse walking, as if that’s even possible, as I hobbled back to this place where I sit and write this story, I know I won’t live, this is all I have and well cannot move well with a mauled leg. Its clear none of this made a difference, I should of just stared directly into the abyss and let it claim me, describing the monster that took me, that would waste to much energy, all I know is death was unavoidable, that monster must have had some massive teeth, as I can see the bone of my own leg, I’m typing this in a pile of blood, I hope someone finds this journal, though I doubt there will be anything left that could understand what I wrote.</p>
